# Vision-Assistive-Caption-Bot
The project goal is to create a caption bot based on the model CNN-LSTM neural networks which detects the objects in the images automatically and generate meaningful descriptions for the images. CNN helps detect the objects in the image and LSTM is to caption the images.
